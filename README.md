This program uses OpenCV and a pre-trained model to recognize faces in realtime through the webcam. After finding the face and creating a bounding box, the program pastes an image onto the face in real time. The purpose of this project is to automate the process of modifying faces through filters and to create a meaningful introduction into machine learning.

Dependencies:
- OpenCV Python
